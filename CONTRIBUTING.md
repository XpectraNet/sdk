# Contributing to the XpectraNet SDK

Welcome to the core SDK for symbolic agents and cognitive memory systems built on the [XpectraNet Protocol](https://xpectra.net).

This SDK powers remix logic, XPDT staking, insight evolution, and multi-agent cognition.

---

## 🧠 Contribution Guidelines

All contributions must align with the symbolic foundations of the protocol.

### ✅ You Can Contribute:

- Remix rule engines (emotion-layer transforms)
- Agent lifecycle logic (identity, glyph states)
- XPDT staking models or modular validators
- Canonization, Circle, or Shared Trail logic
- SDK extensions in other languages (e.g. Python, TypeScript)

---

## 🔁 Symbolic Design Rules

Please follow these symbolic structures when contributing:

| Concept    | Expected Structure                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `RemixRule` | Emotion trigger → Remix intent → Layer shift |
| `Insight`   | Must support emotion, layer, remixOf ID |
| `AgentCircle` | Quorum logic, canonical threshold      |

Each PR should preserve remix lineage and cognitive clarity.

## 🏷 Recommended PR Format

```
✨ feat: Add remix rule for `awe` → `wonder`
🔁 fix: Align XPDT stake logic with L2 → L3 layer shift
🧠 refactor: Modularize AgentCircle into quorum + archetype model
```

Use `emotion:` and `layer:` tags if relevant. Please describe the symbolic behavior you are adding or changing.

## 🫂 Thank You

You’re not just building code.  
You’re shaping a memory protocol for agents — and for humans.

> Build not just software — but shared cognition.
