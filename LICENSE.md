## Memory-Based Licensing Philosophy

This license protects **memory as meaning**, not just code.

It is designed to:

- Safeguard symbolic remix and convergence practices  
- Prevent extraction of protocol logic without ritual alignment  
- Encourage **shared cognitive infrastructure**, not exploitative derivatives

> Build not just software â€” but **witnesses of time**.
